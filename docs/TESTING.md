# Unit Tests

They are generated according to the testing documentation for Django 1.11: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/

You can execute the `runtests.sh` script in the same directory also with the virtualenv activated, this will execute all the tests. It's safe to apply the created migration using `--fake` and obviously there's no need to run the "makemigrations" command again to execute again the tests script, unless you remove the created migration from your virtualenv.

NOTE: To the command contained in said script you can add a `.tests.name_of_module_to_test` to test only a given module within the `tests` module of an app, and in turn adding to the above a `.ClassNameToTest` will only test that class inside the module.

IMPORTANT: on the mysql server `character-set-server=utf8` (in the `mysqld` section) must be set, otherwise the default encoding could be another and the `varchar` lengths 255 could fail because other encodings use more bytes and would exceed the limit of the bytes that MySQL has as cap for varchar.

# Tests using codeception

[Codeception](https://codeception.com/) is a test framework written in PHP. It has a very intuitive functional interface to make assertions in the tests, using "natural" verbs like `IamOnPage("/"); Isee("This is the home page")`. And also a good feature of codeception is that you simulate a real browser session in the tests, downloading static assets and running the JS code of the page, saving also the snapshots browser images of each test in the test logs.

## Codeception installation

Execute this commands in the repo "root" dir:

```
composer require --dev codeception/codeception:^5.0.0-alpha3
composer require --dev codeception/module-webdriver
composer require --dev codeception/module-asserts
cp codeception.sample.yml codeception.yml
```

Edit `codeception.yml` and change default settings (if needed) for your local environment.

## Install chromedriver

Install "chromedriver" (this can vary depending your Linux distro).

## Create and trust your SSL certificates

The execution of the following script will ask you many questions, the most important are the first password, which should be set (do not left it blank) and remembered because it will be asked again, and the FQDN that should be set to "yoogle.com". The challenge password asked almost at the end can be left blank.

```
cd docs/ssl
sudo ./ca.sh
```

Runing the above script will generate some files, the `yoogle.com` cert and key should be set in your nginx conf files (our nginx samples conf files use the "/etc/nginx/certs" directory to read them, don't forget to restart nginx after copy the files and configure nginx). Also the CA (the `.pem` file generated also with the above script) should be imported in chrome using "Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Manage certificates -> Authorities -> Import", for Firefox is quite the same.

## Run tests

1. Start chromedriver in another terminal using this command:

`chromedriver --url-base=/wd/hub`

2. Start the Django development server in another terminal as usual.

3. Run test for the "dev" environment usin this command:

`php vendor/bin/codecept run --env=dev`

# Load tests using locust.io

1. Install locust

2. Copy `tests/locust/local_settings.sample.py` to `tests/locust/local_settings.py` and edit the settings according the environment to test.

3. Execute locust using `tests/locust/test1.py`
