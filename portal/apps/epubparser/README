## TODO

This app should be removed from this project.

## Explanation

In the past, an attempt to create articles from RTF files was made and it was working.
(it was an app that defined the Article's grammar using pyparsing)
... after a couple of hours of research in old emails, we can conclude this history:

2014: The app to create artciles from RTF's was declined by the newsroom, because the most recent information to
      create an article in the CMS was the final PDF and not the individual RTF set.

2015: We started to turn the "rtfparser" app into this "epubparser" app, to export generated epub files from PDF to
      articles.

Import from PDF/RTF is not under the scope of this project, maybe can be under a custom app, but not in the opensource
utopia-cms repo because we can't handle all the article structure variants that can be present in the source files.
