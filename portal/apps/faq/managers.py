    Abstraction of field lookups for managers.

    Returns a dictionary of field lookups for a queryset. The lookups
    will always filter by site. Optionally, if ``status`` is passed to
    the function the objects will also be filtered by the given status.

    This function saves from having to make two different on-site and
    published Managers each for `Topic` and `Question`, and having to move
    Managers out of the `FAQBase` model and into each of the `Topic`
    and `Question` models.
