XHTML Degrader Middleware.

When sending contents with the XHTML media type, application/xhtml+xml, this
module checks to ensure that the user agent (web browser) is capable of
rendering it.  If not, it changes the media type to text/html and makes the
contents more "HTML-friendly" (as per the XHTML 1.0 HTML Compatibility
Guidelines).
